Working can of ...

Known TODOs:
 - compensate for shift mistakes in downscaling (upscaling supposedly fixed)
 - find good default parameters
 - should we use OpenCV or VLFeat sigma values
 - computed correct scaling for VLFeat sigma development between levels
 - make upscaling optional (no octave -1)
 - downscaling directly from initial image (optional)
 - replace Gauss parameters with mix of linear interpolation and modified factors (optional, halves #*)
 - create Gauss kernels that match Gauss filter size for each level (template, mandatory)
